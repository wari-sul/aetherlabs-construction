# Instructions to Complete README Update

The new README content has been created in `README_NEW.md`.

Due to special Unicode characters in the original README.md file (specifically smart quotes in "What's Inside"), the automated edit tool was unable to complete the full replacement.

## To complete the update:

### Option 1: Manual File Replacement (Recommended)
```bash
mv README_NEW.md README.md
```

### Option 2: Git Command
```bash
git mv README_NEW.md README.md
```

## What has been updated in README.md so far:
- ✅ Title changed to "Aether Labs Construction"
- ✅ Added MIT license badge
- ✅ Enhanced "Quick Start" section with multiple server options
- ✅ Expanded "Tech Stack" section with all libraries and versions
- ✅ Added "Project Structure" section
- ✅ Added "Key Features Explained" section

## What still needs to be updated:
- ❌ "What's Inside" section (should be "✨ Features" with detailed list)
- ❌ "Customization" section (needs expansion with code examples)

`README_NEW.md` contains the complete, final version with all updates applied.
